# Incremental Game

## How it works
Just click the "Generate A Points" button and start generating A Points, with which you can buy B Points.

## Any tips? 
- 1 B Point costs 10 A Points and so on
- Upgrades will get unlocked when reaching 100,000 A Points.
- You'll generate more Upgrade Points after the first time unlocking them with each x10 A Points

## Why does it look like shit?
I have other features planned I'm working on. Don't be rude!
